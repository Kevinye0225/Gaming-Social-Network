# create_data_structure(string_input): 
#   Parses a block of text (such as the one above) and stores relevant 
#   information into a data structure. You are free to choose and design any 
#   data structure you would like to use to manage the information.
# 
# Arguments: 
#   string_input: block of text containing the network information
#
#   You may assume that for all the test cases we will use, you will be given the 
#   connections and games liked for all users listed on the right-hand side of an
#   'is connected to' statement. For example, we will not use the string 
#   "A is connected to B.A likes to play X, Y, Z.C is connected to A.C likes to play X."
#   as a test case for create_data_structure because the string does not 
#   list B's connections or liked games.
#   
#   The procedure should be able to handle an empty string (the string '') as input, in
#   which case it should return a network with no users.

# Arguments:
#   network: The network you created with create_data_structure.

# - Be careful how you handle connection loops, for example, A is connected to B.

#   that case.
# - If you are comfortable with default parameters, you might consider using one 
#   in this procedure to keep track of nodes already visited in your search. You 
#   may safely add default parameters since all calls used in the grading script 
#   will only include the arguments network, user_A, and user_B.
